# llms-learning

A repository sharing the literatures about Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)



## More to Learn

* This repo is a sub-track for my [dgm-learning](https://github.com/Strivin0311/dgm-learning) repo, where you can learn more technologies about the deep generative models
* I've also built another repo [long-llms-learning](https://github.com/Strivin0311/long-llms-learning), to specifically share the literature about how to model and evaluate the long-context capabilities of LLMs, with a survey paper attached
