data link: [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Norquinal/claude_multiround_chat_30k)

This dataset is the result of 50k instruction/response pairs generated by Claude and two additional follow-up instructions for each base instruction (for a total of 150k instructions), with instances of blatant alignment removed. 
32170 (96510) instructions remain.

The instructions were generated synethically using a method that can be tenatively described as "multi-instruct." These instructions consist of numerous discrete tasks that the AI has to work its way through, thereby hopefully increasing its comprehension and awareness of complex instructions.

The topics of the instruction ranged from STEM, Arts & Humanities, Social Knowledge, and General Knowledge.
