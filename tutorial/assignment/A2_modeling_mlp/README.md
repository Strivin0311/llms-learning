# assignment-2-modeling-mlp
For this assignment, we are continuing to design modeling tasks to help you gain a deeper understanding of transformer's component modules. 

Specifically, we will focus on one of the pivotal layers that form the backbone of the transformer structure: the mlp layer.


## Tasks

### Task 1: Dense MLP with LoRA Adapters

Please read the description [here](./tasks/task1.md).

### Task 2: Sparse MLP with LoRA Adapters

Please read the description [here](./tasks/task2.md).


## Environment

* You should have python 3.10+ installed on your machine.
* (*Optional*) You had better have Nvidia GPU(s) with CUDA12.0+ installed on your machine, otherwise some features may not work properly (*We will do our best to ensure that the difference in hardware does not affect your score.*).
* You are supposed to install all the necessary dependencies with the following command, **which may vary a little among different assignments**.
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* (*Optional*) You are strongly recommended to use a docker image from [Nvidia Pytorch Release](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/index.html) like [23.10](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/rel-23-10.html#rel-23-10) or some newer version as your basic environment in case of denpendency conflicts.


## Submission

* You need to submit your assignment by `git commit` and `git push` this private repository **on the `main` branch** with the specified source files required to fullfill above **before the hard deadline**, otherwise **the delayed assignment will be rejected automatically**.
* Try **NOT to push unnecessary files**, especially some large ones like images, to your repository.
* If you encounter some special problems causing you miss the deadline, please contact the teacher directly (*See [Contact](#contact)*).


## Scoring

* Each assignment will be scored of the points in the range of `0~100` by downloading your code and running the `test_script.sh` script to execute a `test_score.py` file (*invisible to you as empty files*) for some test cases, where the specific files described in [Tasks](#tasks) will be imported locally on our own machine.
* **ALL** the files required to fulfill in [Tasks](#tasks) are under the `src/` directory, which is the **ONLY** directory that will be imported as a **python module**. Therefore, there are several things you should pay attention to:
    * 1. The `__init__.py` is essential for a python module, and we have already initialized all the necessary ones in `src/` for you, so **be careful** when you intend to modify any of them for personal purposes.
    * 2. If you have any other files supposed to be internally imported like `utils.py`, please make sure that they are all under the `src/` directory and **imported relatively** e.g. `from .utils import *`,  `from .common.utils import ...`, etc.
* You will get the maximum score of `100` points if you pass all the tests within the optional time limit.
* You will get the minimum score of `0` points if you fail all the tests within the optional time limit, or run into some exceptions.
* You will get any other score of the points in the middle of `0~100` if you pass part of the tests within the optional time limit, which is the sum of the scores of all the passed test cases as shown in the following table.
    | Test Case | Score | Other Info |
    | --------- | ----- | ---------- |
    | Task1 - Case1 | 10 |  |
    | Task1 - Case2 | 10 |  |
    | Task1 - Case3 | 10 |  |
    | Task1 - Case4 | 10 |  |
    | Task2 - Case1 | 10 |  |
    | Task2 - Case2 | 10 |  |
    | Task2 - Case3 | 10 |  |
    | Task2 - Case4 | 10 |  |
    | Task2 - Case5 | 10 |  |
    | Task2 - Case6 | 10 |  |
    | Total         | 100|  |
* To help you debug:
    * 1. We will give some test cases as toy examples in the visible `test_toy.py` file, and you had better ensure your code works correctly on your own machine before submitting, with the following command (*Feel free to modify the `test_toy.py` file to your specific debugging needs, since we wouldn't run it to score your code*).
        ```python
        pytest test_toy.py
        ```
    * 2. We will pre-test on your intermediate submission **as frequently as possible**, and offer only the score feedback (*See [Feedback](#feedback)*) each time to allow you to improve your code for higher scores before the hard ddl.
* **Note:** The testing methods provided in the `test_toy.py` file are for debugging purposes only, and may differ from the actual tests we use in `test_score.py` to test and score your code. Thus, be careful, particularly when handling edge cases.


## Feedback

* After scoring your assignment, We will give you a score table like the example one shown below in a new file named `score.md`, by pushing it within a new commit to your repository on a temporary branch called `score-feedback` (*This branch is only for you to view your status on each test cases after every scoring, please do NOT use it for any other purposes*).
    | Test Case | Score | Status | Error Message |
    | --------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- |
    | Task1 - Case1 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task1 - Case2 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task1 - Case3 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task1 - Case4 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task2 - Case1 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task2 - Case2 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task2 - Case3 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task2 - Case4 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task2 - Case5 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Task2 - Case6 | 10 | ‚úÖ | |
    | Total         | üòä | ‚úÖ | |

* The meaning of the status icons are listed below:
    * ‚úÖ: passed the case
    * ‚ùå: failed the case due to wrong answers
    * üïõ: failed the case due to timeout if the time limit is set
    * ‚ùì: failed the case due to some exceptions (the error message will be shown at the corresponding `Error Message` cell)
    * üòä: all passed
    * ü•∫: failed at least one case
