# assignment-4-modeling-transformer
Finally! 

For this assignment, we are going to bring all the modules we've built in the previous assignments together, and construct a complete decoder-only transformer


## Tasks

### Task 1: Transformer Decoder KVCache

Please read the description [here](./tasks/task1.md).

### Task 2: Transformer Decoder Layer

Please read the description [here](./tasks/task2.md).

### Task 3: Transformer Decoder Block

Please read the description [here](./tasks/task3.md).


## Environment

* You should have python 3.10+ installed on your machine.
* (*Optional*) You had better have Nvidia GPU(s) with CUDA12.0+ installed on your machine, otherwise some features may not work properly (*We will do our best to ensure that the difference in hardware does not affect your score.*).
* You are supposed to install all the necessary dependencies with the following command, **which may vary a little among different assignments**.
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* (*Optional*) You are strongly recommended to use a docker image from [Nvidia Pytorch Release](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/index.html) like [23.10](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/rel-23-10.html#rel-23-10) or some newer version as your basic environment in case of denpendency conflicts.
